# Severity Model

Use these labels for each finding:

- `High`: likely production failure, data/security risk, or critical requirement not met.
- `Medium`: important correctness or maintainability issue with moderate user impact.
- `Low`: minor issue, readability concern, or non-critical gap.

Each finding must include:
- Severity
- File path with line reference
- Why it matters
- Suggested fix direction
